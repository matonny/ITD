Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. These statistics refer to infections occurring in private households. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. This table is based on analysis of nose and throat swabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. All estimates are subject to uncertainty, given that a sample is only part of the wider population. Confidence intervals have been provided for the 14-day weighted estimates and credible intervals are provided for the Bayesian modelled weekly estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Due to the timeliness of the data received from the laboratories and occurrence of public holidays there are gaps and overlaps between some of our official estimates, this does not impact the comparability of these estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Official reported estimates are plotted at a reference point believed to be most representative of the given week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Some figures (-) were not published at the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7. Survey fieldwork for the pilot study began in England on 26 April 2020. In Wales, fieldwork began on 29 June 2020, in Northern Ireland fieldwork began on 26 July 2020 and in Scotland fieldwork began on 21 September 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9. For the official estimates published on 13 August, 3 September, 29 October, 3 December, 10 December 2021 and 14 January 2022 the reference weeks differ between UK countries. This is due to the models ending on different days in those weeks.					",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10. As there was no publication on 15 January 2021 there are no official estimates available for the week ending 9 January 2021. However, we have conducted some additional analysis to assess what the estimate may have been and have provided an estimate in the table above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
